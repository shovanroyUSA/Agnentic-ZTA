#  Agentic-ZTA: Agentic AI based Zero Trust Architecture

This repository presents an Agentic AI based Zero Trust architecture (Agentic-ZTA) where autonomous AI agents are entrusted to enforce zero trust principles. These agents
independently identify and respond to vulnerabilities and take decisions without human oversights. It emphasizes secure explainability, behavioral fingerprinting, and resilient multi-agent workflows.

##  Integration Philosophy

Agentic-ZTA is built on three pillars:

- **Agentic Modularity**: Each agent operates autonomously with secure boundaries and explainable behavior.
- **Zero Trust Enforcement**: No implicit trust—every access is verified, logged, and auditable.
- **Secure Explainability**: SHAP protocols, behavioral fingerprinting, and audit integrity ensure transparency without compromising security.
