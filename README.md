# 🧠 Agentic-ZTA: Agentic AI with Zero Trust Architecture

This repository presents a modular framework for integrating Agentic AI systems with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). It emphasizes secure explainability, behavioral fingerprinting, and resilient multi-agent workflows.

## 🧩 Integration Philosophy

Agentic-ZTA is built on three pillars:

- **Agentic Modularity**: Each agent operates autonomously with secure boundaries and explainable behavior.
- **Zero Trust Enforcement**: No implicit trust—every access is verified, logged, and auditable.
- **Secure Explainability**: SHAP protocols, behavioral fingerprinting, and audit integrity ensure transparency without compromising security.
